# Markdown Blog Posts Template

- This is where you write your blog, using your favorite **Markdown** and **Git**.
- The *Markdown files* **only** in the [drafts](./drafts) and [published](./published) directories will be **synchronized** to your blog as **posts**.

	When you `git push` after `git commit`, it will trigger the synchronization.

- [drafts](./drafts) are visible only to you on the blog.

## Categories

- We support up to two levels of nested categories in [drafts](./drafts) and [published](./published) directories to be synchronized to your blog.

	The third-level and above categories will be ignored, but the Markdown files in them will be placed in the second-level categories in your blog.
