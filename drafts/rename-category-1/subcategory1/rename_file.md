## You can modify the 'permalink' at any time without worrying about SEO weight of the post being reduced.

That's because we append a unique string (e.g.: `-i3K`) to the end of each article link.
So for this post, the real path would be like `https://example.com/this-is-an-example-post-i3K`.

Visiting a stale URL will be redirected to the fresh URL with status 301.
